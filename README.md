> The Ten Principles of Midburn

This is the frontend application of https://games.midburn.org. The backend application repo can be found at https://github.com/midburn/burner-games
Burner games is a simple trivia game developed by the midburn.org organization volunteers as an educational step for the Midburn organization ticketing system. While playing the game, the participants will be questioned about Midburn 10 principeles which are the primary guidance of the Midburn Organization.

Our goal is to educate all Midburn events participants about the 10 principles, the events' vibe and explain the participants' behavior in a simple, fun & humoristic way.
